# 💌 A Special Connection Established

Hi! If you are reading this, it means you've found your way to my little corner of the internet. 

I wrote a small program from scratch in C to tell you something. Think of it as a digital letter that only runs on your command.

### 📦 How to open your gift:

1. Look at the **Releases** section on the right side of this page (or click [HERE](https://github.com/MrPURUSOTTAM/Fictional_princess/releases/tag/v1.0)).
2. Download the `HELLO.zip` file under "Assets".
3. Right-click the zip file and **Extract All**.
4. Open the folder and double-click the `.exe` file.

### 🛠️ Technical Note (Just for you!)
* **Security:** Because I am a student developer and not a big company like Microsoft, Windows might show a blue box saying *"Windows protected your PC"*. 
* **The Fix:** Just click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"**. I promise it's just my code!
* **Navigation:** Once the program starts, follow the instructions on the screen. Press **ESC** whenever you're ready to close it.
